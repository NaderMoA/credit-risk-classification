# credit-risk-classification
in this model we tried to classify the y data (loan status) into two class (0 and 1) healthy and high risk and we test to see how well and accurate our model perfomed: based on the classification report: the accuracy of the model is apox 99% which means the model correcltly predicts the class labels for 99% of the samples in the testing dataset Precision Scores: all the prediction for negative (class 0) are correct 85% of all predicted positive (class 1) are correct Recall Scores: 99% of the actual negatives are correctly predicted. (class 0) 91% of the actual positives are correctly predicted (class 1)

the model succesfully predicted 91% of high risk loans, which could be used as an assistant tool for stress test of the client to determine if the loan will be hish risk or not. however there is one issue, the data is imbalanced and there number of support for 0 is almost 3 times of that of class 1 (18765 vs 619) therefore using algorithms that can handle imbalanced dataset could be agood option as well to confirm the model and the scores. however in reality the accuracy score is usually in the range of 85%-95% which is also considered the industry standard.
